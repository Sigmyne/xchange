The __xchange__ library provides structured data representation and exchange in C/C++, and includes support for JSON 
parsing and generation. It is free to use, in any way you like, without licensing restrictions.

For JSON parsing end emitting, __xchange__ provides a higher-level data model than __cjson__, with high-level 
functions for accessing and manipulating data both with less code and with cleaner code.

The __xchange__ library was created, and is maintained, by Attila Kovács (Sigmyne, LLC), and it is available through 
the [Sigmyne/xchange](https://github.com/Sigmyne/xchange) repository on GitHub.
